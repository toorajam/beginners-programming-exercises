# Exercises for practicing coding with conditions

* These exercises are designed to practice coding with conditions.
* Keep the order of the exercises. The first one is the simplest, and the hardest is the last one.
* Your task is to write a body for each exercise to print the desired output.
* Programming language does not matter. Change the function syntax into your language syntax but keep the inputs.
* Do not change the number of inputs.
* Do not use the programming language's prepared functions.
* Do not forget to test your code with special inputs like 0, 1, 2, and a large number.

## Prerequisites
* variables 
* conditions
