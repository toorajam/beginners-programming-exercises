# Exercises for practicing coding with loops

* These exercises are designed to practice coding with loops.
* Keep the order of the exercises. The first one is the simplest, and the hardest is the last one.
* Your task is to write a body for each exercise function to print the desired output.
* Try not to use sibling loops.
* Do not change the number of inputs.
* Do not use the programming language's prepared functions.
* Do not forget to test your code with special inputs like 0, 1, 2, and a large number.
